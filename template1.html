		<h1>Introduction</h1>
	</header>
		<br>
		Human life depends on the world to sustain them. With the rate of deforestation and pollution in the ocean it makes it almost certain that humans will be extinct much before we thought. Over 3 billion people rely on the ocean for their food. Islands like Japan depends mostly on the ocean. With all of this garbage being put in the ocean it effects the food we are putting into our bodys.
		<br>
		<br>
		Not only are animals being hunted to extinction but effects from humans are also killing them. For example, many animals in the artic are being greatly effected by global warming and their homes literally melting away.
		<br>
		<br>
		Earth can be inhabitable in 150 million years. This may seem like a lot of time. However, compared to what it would have been if humans had not made their perminant damage to the Earth.
